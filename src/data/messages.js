  rules: `# General Rules

1.1. No bullying, harassment, hate speech (homophobia, racism, sexism, xenophobia, and etc. are included), political stuff. Long conflicts/debates are not allowed.
1.1.1. This also implies about responding to the offender. It's better to ask moderators to deal with the offender instead of making conflicts with them.
1.1.2. Stay at the neutral ground when it comes to religious, political, social, and similar matters. Don't try to impose your opinion on another person.
1.2. No spam and flood.
1.3. No NSFW content outside of NSFW channels. This includes emojis, stickers and etc.
1.4. No advertisements, scam/suspicious links, and pay-per-click links. Also we're not allowing distribution of illegal/pirated/cracked/etc. software of any kind.
1.4.1. Self-advertisements are generally not allowed, but if you're an artist/musician/etc. you can do self-advertisement within the bounds of decency (no spam and begging obviously).
1.5. No fights between servers.
1.6. Do not beg for free keys.
1.7. Don't use Support Chats to chit-chat. These channels should be for support only.

# Member Protection Rules

2.1. No spam and scam in member DMs.
2.2. No hate speech and harassment (of any type) in member DMs.
2.3. Same as 1.6., but this also implies to member DMs.
2.4. If you're objectively making other members uncomfortable, moderators have rights to deal with it by either confronting or punishing the offender.
2.5. If there's something that bothers our member in DMs, moderators have rights to deal with it by either confronting or punishing the offender.

# Voice Chat Rules

3.1. Loud/annoying music and sound effects are not allowed unless other members in this voice chat don't mind it.
3.2. If you have too much noise on your background, please consider using Push-to-Talk.
3.3. NSFW content is not allowed.
3.4. Every rule in **General Rules** applies to **Voice Chat Rules**.

# Responsibility

4.1. Most of the times, punishments dealt by staff members are completely fair. If you disagree with your punishment, please talk to that staff member who dealt punishment. If you failed to reach out to that staff member or you felt uncomfortable to do so, DM any <@&1393015367491649588> or higher about this.
4.2. Bypassing the punishment by using an alt account or a bug is not allowed. If you get caught doing this, we're immediately banning original account and alt account.
4.3. **Rules can be adjusted in any point and punishments can be dealt by something that's not specifically written in these rules under extraordinary situations. If you disagree with your punishment, refer to the Rule 4.1.**

**What you can do as a regular rule obedient member?**
* If you see a member that's not following the rules or making others uncomfortable - ping/DM a staff member from your chat. It's very recommended to not intervene into conflict with the offender, just patiently wait for a staff member to deal with the situation.
* If you see a staff member that breaks the rules, makes others uncomfortable and/or doesn't do his job as intended, DM any <@&1393015367491649588> about it.
